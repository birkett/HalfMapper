# FindGLEW
# --------
#
# Find the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW)
#
# IMPORTED Targets
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module defines the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target ``GLEW::GLEW``,
# if GLEW has been found.
#
# Result Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module defines the following variables:
#
# ::
#
#   GLEW_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directories for GLEW
#   GLEW_LIBRARIES - libraries to link against GLEW
#   GLEW_FOUND - true if GLEW has been found and can be used
#
# Modified by Anthony Birkett
# * Added Windows support through the envvar GLEW
# * Path pointed to by %GLEW% will be searched
# * Added 64 bit checks
